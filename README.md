Contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective and my PowerPoint Presentation from my CS 250 Final Project.

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Communication is a major componenet when it comes interpreting and implementing user needs into a program. To start, one must
carefully read and understand the requirements of the project. Identifying what the problem is and how it will be solved is the
next step in this process. If it is determined that the provided information is too broad and further clarification is needed, 
communication must be exercised and questions must be asked to ensure that development is going in the right direction.
User stories are a crucial part in the process as it helps keep the team organized on project requirements by outlining 
brief and descriptive statements of the client's needs.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

When approaching program development, I tend to use a more iterative and incremental method. Making smaller functional parts 
of the project and getting early feedback helps me to improve and deliver a quality product. Agile processes that I hope to 
incorporate in my future work include sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Qualities of a good team member should include the ability to communicate effectively, be reliable, and be actively 
contributing to both the project and the team's collaborative environment. Having empathy, respect for different perspectives, 
and a willingness to help others resolve challenges are also important characteristics of a good team member. In an Agile 
environment, participating in ceremonies, sharing feedback, and accountability are essential for team success.
